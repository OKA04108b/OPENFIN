### Congifuration Instructions
 - I decided to divide the test size by 0.01. I put the test size differently to evaluate my code. I thought making the test size very small would result the train accuracy low, but I thought the test data would be more accurate than the train accuracy because the amount of trained data is large.

<code>
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.01, random_state=0)
